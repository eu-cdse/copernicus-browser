"# Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)\n"
"\n"
"Normalized Burn Ratio is frequently used to estimate burn severity. It uses "
"near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) wavelengths. Healthy "
"vegetation has a high reflectance in the near-infrared portion of the "
"spectrum, and a low short-wave infrared reflectance. On the other hand, "
"burned areas have a high shortwave infrared reflectance but low reflectance "
"in the near infrared Darker pixels indicate burned areas.\n"
