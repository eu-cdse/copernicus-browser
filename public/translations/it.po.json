The chlorophyll values in between range from red (low chlorophyll values) to dark green (high chlorophyll values) can be used to determine vegetation health.\n\n\n\nMore info [here.](https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-3/otci/)","msgstr":[""]},"Create a timelapse of this area":{"msgid":"Create a timelapse of this area","msgstr":[""]},"Warning: Following layers use dataProducts, so the desired data type might not be set:":{"msgid":"Warning: Following layers use dataProducts, so the desired data type might not be set:","msgstr":[""]},"Warning: Evalscript is not in a typical V3 format and the desired data type could not be set for:":{"msgid":"Warning: Evalscript is not in a typical V3 format and the desired data type could not be set for:","msgstr":[""]},"This means \"sampleType\" parameter is likely set to default (AUTO).

In this composite vegetation appears in shades of green, soils and built-up areas are in various shades of brown, and water appears black.
